By John Kelly, Sean Brennan, Quinn Luong, and Priscilla Wong
## Hypothesis
### Which machine learning model best forecasts stock prices?

## Model 1: LSTM RNN Using VIX (volatility index) as a predictor of RUT (Russell 2000)'s prices

## Model 2: LSTM RNN Using historical prices of RUT (Russell 2000) as a predictor of it's future prices

## Model 3: Holt-Winters model using exponential smoothing and seasonality aspects to use VIX as a predictor of RUT's future prices
